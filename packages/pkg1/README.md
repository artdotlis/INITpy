# pkg1

**An example package that lives inside the INITpy monorepo.**

---

## 📦 About

`pkg1` is one of the first‑level projects bundled in the repository.  
It demonstrates how a standalone application can depend on the
internal `shared_utils` library and expose a console script entry
point (`pkg1`).

Because it is part of a monorepo, the package is **private** – it
should not be published to PyPI – and is built along with the other
packages via the `uv` build system.

---

## 📚 Installation & Build

The package is automatically built when you run:

```bash
# From the repository root
make runBuild
```

There is no separate `pip install` step for consuming `pkg1` from
outside this repo; it is included in the repository’s wheel
distribution.

If you add external dependencies, declare them in the root
`pyproject.toml` or in this sub‑module’s `[project.dependencies]`.

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### Console script

```bash
# From the repository root (or any virtual‑env that has the repo’s
# packages on `sys.path`):
pkg1
```

Running the script will execute `pkg1.main:run`.

### Importing in code

```python
from pkg1.main import run
```
